*Templates*

  - Need way to do templates
  - Need to be able relate to data values but also to directories
    - Like "here's a field value to plug into some field placeholder in the template" but also "here's a file (a template for a file) which should be created for each x"
  - Templates internaly need loop and conditional logic
    - "for each one of these insert this section of the template"
    - "if we have one of these then insert this section of the template"
    - Look for templating engines
        - Maybe like yeoman/bower?
